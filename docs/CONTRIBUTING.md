# 1. Intro
Welcome! First of all, I would like to thank you for your interest in our project. We want to make this a simple process for you, so if you would like to contribute, please continue reading.

# 2. Standards
We want to keep this project a safe environment for anyone to contribute. We would like everyone to follow these guidelines to stay proffesional. 

- Being respectful towards opposing viewpoints, have a discussion, not a fight.
- Be constructive, give feedback that we can build on.

Thats it! If you follow these guidelines, you should have a very good time here.

# 3. Making your First Contribution
We love feedback, if you have any ideas, we would love to hear them! Whether it's:
- Providing feedback on the quality, functionality or performance
- Submitting improvements
- Fixing a bug
- Reporting an issue

All of these can be done by either:
- Making an [issue](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/issues/new/choose)
- Creating a [pull request](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/pulls)

# 3.1. Adding to the code
When contributing, please be mindful of what you are doing.
Think of these while contributing:
- Will this break anything? Can it be fixed while keeping the improvement?
- What does this affect? Is it placebo?
- Has it been thoroughly tested/discussed?

# 4. Testing and Review
Doing all of these aren't required but appreciated. Please mention in the pull request what you have completed.
Testing and reviewing should be very easy here's what to test:
- Look over your changes, make sure there's nothing you missed.
- First, test it on a virtual machine, my recommedation is VMWare Workstation. A good alternative is Oracle VirtualBox.
- Test what your contribution affects, this is dependant on what you change.
- Test basic programs and functionalities.
- Test on an actual machine now, repeat the steps.

I (zusier), will be the main tester and reviewer, if you would like to become a reviewer/tester, please make an [issue.](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/issues/new/)
