## ü§î **What is Atlas?**

Atlas is a modified version of Windows 10, which removes all the negative drawbacks of Windows that adversely affect gaming performance. We are a transparent and open source project striving for equal rights for players whether you are running a low-end, or a gaming PC.

We are also a great option to reduce system latency, network latency, input lag, and keep your system private while keeping our main focus on performance.

## üÜö **Windows vs. Atlas**

### üîí Private
Atlas removes all types of tracking embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection. Things outside the scope of Windows we can not increase privacy for, such as websites you visit.

### üõ°Ô∏è Secure
Atlas aims to be secure as possible without losing performance. We do this by disabling features that can leak information or be exploited. There are exceptions to this such as [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf), and [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf). These mitigations are disabled to improve performance.

If a security mitigation measure decreases performance, it will be disabled.
Below are some features/mitigations that have been altered, if they contain a (P) they are security risks that have been fixed:

- [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)
- [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)
- [DMA Remapping](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/kernel-dma-protection-for-thunderbolt)
- (P) [ATMFD Exploit](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2020-1020)
- (P) [Print Nightmare](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/06/30/printnightmare-critical-windows-print-spooler-vulnerability)
- [Remote Desktop](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=Windows+Remote+Desktop)
- [NetBIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS) (*Posible information retrieval*)

### üöÄ Debloated
Atlas is heavily stripped, pre-installed applications and other components are removed. Despite the possibility of compatibility issues, this significantly decreases ISO and install size. Functionalities such as Windows Defender, and such are stripped completely. 

This modification is focused on pure gaming, but most work and education applications work. [Check out what else we have removed in our FAQ](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/wiki/1.-FAQ#13-whats-removed-in-atlas-os).

### ‚úÖ Performant
Atlas is pre-tweaked. While maintaining compatibility, but also striving for performance, we have squeezed every last drop of performance into our Windows images. 

Some of the many changes that we have done to improve Windows have been listed below.

- Customized power scheme
- Reduced amount of services and drivers
- Disabled audio exclusive
- Disabled unneeded devices
- Disabled power savings
- Disabled performance-hungry security mitigations
- Automatically enabled MSI mode on all devices
- Boot configuration optimization
- Optimized process scheduling
