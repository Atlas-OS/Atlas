# Translation guide

First of all: thank you for considering helping us by translating the documents! Please follow this short guide for contributing a Translation!


- Copy the `README.MD` from [here](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main/translations/README_translate.md) and rename it to the language's corrosponding ISO code (e.g. `README_zh_CN.md`).

- Translate the file, keep your translation close to the original text, and make sure to follow the stuff below.

```
**THE DISCLAIMER SHOULD NOT BE TRANSLATED**. Keep the disclaimer section as it's link form.

Do not modify the original "README_translate.md" formatting.

Avoid changing anything other then the text you need to translate.

"Atlas", "Spectre" and "Meltdown" should all be kept in English, due to "Atlas" being the organization name and the rest being documented names.
```

- Add the flag button for the translated document into the main [README.md](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main) (make sure to put it in alphabetical order of it's ISO code.)

- Double check your translation.

- Final step! create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/compare) and we will review it!
