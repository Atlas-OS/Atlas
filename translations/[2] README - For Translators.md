# Translation guide

First of all: thank you for considering helping us by translating the documents! Here are some small things you should remember before creating a translated `README.MD`.

- Copy the `README.MD` from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/main/README.md) and rename it to the language's corrosponding ISO code (e.g. `README_zh_CN.md`).

- Keep the disclaimer in link form and **DO NOT TRANSLATE THE DISCLAIMER**.

- Keep your translation close to the original text.

- Do not modify the original `README.md` formatting.

- Avoid changing anything other then the text you need to translate (if you need to, make sure to mention it in your pull request).

- Double check your translation before submitting a pull request.

- "`Atlas`", "`Spectre`" and "`Meltdown`" should all be kept in English, due to "`Atlas`" being the company name and the rest being documented names.
