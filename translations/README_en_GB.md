# Right-o mate, let me tell you a jolly good thing, what's Atlas you ask? 

Well, it's only a blimmin' marvellous version of Windows 10, innit? It gets rid of all the rubbish stuff that slows down gaming. We're an open and transparent lot, and we want all players to have the same chances, whether you're using a poxy old PC or a top-of-the-line gaming rig.

But that's not all, chum! We also sort out system latency, network latency, and input lag, and keep your system all hush-hush while we focus on giving you the best performance possible! Cheers, Atlas, you're a proper legend!

## Windows vs. Atlas

### **Now listen here, mate! If you're like me, you'll want to keep all your business private!**

Atlas removes all types of tracking embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection. Things outside the scope of Windows we can not increase privacy for, such as websites you visit.

### **Atlas is the dog's bollocks when it comes to privacy! **
We make sure there ain't no sneaky tracking going on, and we use all sorts of fancy group policies to minimize any data collection. Of course, we can't do nothing about them pesky websites you visit, but we've got you covered where we can. So, what are you waiting for? Give Atlas a go and keep your bits and bobs all to yourself! Cheers!

### **Now, pay attention, chap! If you're serious about gaming, you don't want any of that bloated nonsense weighing you down, right?**

That's where Atlas comes in! We've stripped away all the pre-installed apps and other guff that you don't need, which makes the install size much smaller. We even got rid of things like Windows Defender - who needs that anyway? This mod is all about giving you the purest gaming experience possible, even though there might be a few snags here and there. But don't just take my word for it, have a butcher's at our FAQ and see for yourself what else we've given the heave-ho! Cheers, Atlas, you're a proper diamond!

### **Well, now, old bean, if you're after a Windows system that runs like a finely-tuned Bentley, look no further than Atlas!**

We've pre-tweaked this bad boy to within an inch of its life, while still making sure it plays nicely with your other gear. We're all about the performance, don't you know, and we've pulled out all the stops to make sure you get every last drop of it. If you're curious about all the changes we've made to this beast, have a butcher's at the list below! Atlas, you're a proper star!

- Customized power scheme
- Reduced amount of services and drivers
- Disabled audio exclusive
- Disabled unneeded devices
- Disabled power savings
- Disabled performance-hungry security mitigations
- Automatically enabled MSI mode on all devices
