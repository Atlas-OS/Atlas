# 'Da hell is Atlas?

Lemme tell ya somethin' 'bout this here Atlas. It's a modded version of that fancy Microsoft Windows 10. Now, what's wrong with good ole' Windows 10 ya ask? Well, let me tell ya, it's got some drawbacks that slow down yer gammin' performance. That's why we done gone and made Atlas, we's all 'bout givin' equal chances to them low-end and high-performance gamers alike.

We's a transparent and open-source project, so ya know we ain't hidin' nothin' from ya. We's also got yer back when it comes to cuttin' down system lag, network latency, input lag, and keepin' yer system private. We's all 'bout performance, that's our main focus 'round here.

## Windows vs. Atlas

### **Private**

But let me tell ya, with Atlas, yer computer is as private as a squirrel's stash of acorns in the fall. No more Big Brother watchin' over ya shoulder, nosiree.

### **Shore up Security**

Atlas is all 'bout keepin' ya secure while keepin' that performance at top notch. We done gone and turned off all them features that could leak information or git exploited. Now, there might be a few exceptions, like that Spectre and Meltdown business, but we done disabled them mitigations fer better performance. If a security measure slows down yer system, we ain't havin' none of that neither. So, here's a rundown of what we done changed, and we put a little (P) next to the ones that was a security risk but we done fixed 'em good:

- [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)
- [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)
- [DMA Remapping](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/kernel-dma-protection-for-thunderbolt)
- [(P) ATMFD Exploit](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2020-1020)
- [(P) Print Nightmare](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/06/30/printnightmare-critical-windows-print-spooler-vulnerability)
- [Remote Desktop](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=Windows+Remote+Desktop)
- [NetBIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS) (_Possible Information Retrieval_)

### **Debloated and Rarin' to Go!**

Atlas is stripped down and ready to rock! We done done gone and took out all them pre-installed apps and doo-dads that was slowin' ya down. It may cause some hiccups with compatibility, but that's a small price to pay for all the pure gamblin' performance ya'll be gettin' outta this here rig. We done took out Windows Defender and all them fancy security features too, 'cause we believe in gettin' the job done right and fast. Ain't no time for slow-pokin' software! But don't ya worry, most work and school applications still run like a dream. Head on over to our FAQ to see what else we done done gone and cut out!

### **Performant**

Y'all better believe that Atlas is the most performant version of Windows you'll ever lay yer eyes on! We've made darn sure of that. We've taken the ol' Windows and given it a proper tune-up, tweakin' and fine-tunin' ever' aspect of the darn thing. From the power scheme to the boot configuration, we've left no stone unturned in our quest for maximum performance.

- Got us a customized power scheme, cranks up that performance like a hot rod
- Thinned out them services and drivers, runnin' lean and mean
- urned off that audio exclusive, yer games and movies'll sound just fine
= Unplugged them unneeded devices, not a wire or cable in sight
- Cut the power savings, full steam ahead all the time
- Done disabled them performance-hungry security measures, keepin' yer games runnin' smooth
- Automatically enabled MSI mode on all them devices, now that's a hot rod
- Boot configuration optimization, gettin' us from zero to sixty in no time
- Optimized process scheduling, yer games runnin' like clockwork
