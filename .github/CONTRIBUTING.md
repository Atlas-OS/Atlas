# 1. Intro

Welcome! First of all, I would like to thank you for your interest in our project. We want to make this a simple process for you, so if you would like to contribute, please continue reading.

# 2. Standards

We want to keep this project a safe environment for anyone to contribute. We would like everyone to follow these guidelines to stay proffesional. 
- Being respectful towards opposing viewpoints, have a discussion, not a fight.
- Be constructive, give feedback that we can build on.

That is it! If you follow these guidelines, you should have a very good time here.

# 3. Making your first contribution

We love feedback, if you have any ideas, we would love to hear them! Whether it is:
- Providing feedback on the quality, functionality or performance.
- Submitting improvements.
- Fixing a bug.
- Reporting an issue.

All of these can be done by either:

- Making an [issue](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/issues/new/choose)
- Creating a [pull request](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/pulls)

## 3.1. Adding to the code

When contributing, please be mindful of what you are doing.
Think of these while contributing:
- Will this break anything? Can it be fixed while keeping the improvement?
- What does this affect? Is it placebo?
- Has it been thoroughly tested/discussed?

# 4. Testing and review

Doing all of these are not required but appreciated. Please mention in the pull request what you have completed.
Testing and reviewing should be very easy here is what to test:
- Look over your changes, make sure there is nothing you missed.
- First, test it on a virtual machine, my recommedation is [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com). A good alternative is [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org).
- Test what your contribution affects, this is dependant on what you change.
- Test basic programs and functionalities.
- Test on an actual machine now, repeat the steps.

We [(Zusier)](https://github.com/Zusier) and [(Syrm)](https://github.com/SyrmGIT) will be the main testers and reviewers, if you would like to become a reviewer/tester, please make an [issue.](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/issues/new)

# 5. Rewards and benefits

By contributing to the AtlasOS project, we may reward you as a thank you for the work you have done to help our community. You will be able to redeem a "Contributor" role in our Discord server as a thank you for your assistance.
Whatever is enough to claim that role is up to us to decide. However, as long as you remain active within issues and discussions, ask for assistance, and report issues, you should be there in no time.

Keep in mind. You will only be able to claim the rewards and benefits if your responses are:
- Properly structured.
- Contains solid advice and/or information.
- Understandable by anyone.
- Provides the help asked for and required.
