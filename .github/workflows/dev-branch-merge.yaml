            This pull request was automatically created by GitHub Actions, and it is automatically done at the start of every Monday or manually ran. It merges all of the changes that were made to the \`dev\` branch into the \`main\` branch.
            
            The reason why the [\`dev\`](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/tree/dev) branch exists is to make sure that all of the code in [\`main\`](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas) has been properly reviewed and approved. **Five contributors** have to approve this pull request for it to be merged.
