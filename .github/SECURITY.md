## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

We at Atlas try our best to do improvements to security out-of-the-box for all users installing our operating system.

Since AtlasOS is based around Windows 10, a closed-source OS made by Microsoft, we do not have a lot of options when it comes to solutions to security vulnerabilities. Thus, we kindly ask you to report any security vulnerabilities with our operating system you find to Microsoft and not us. 

You can read and learn more about reporting security vulnerabilities and pentesting over at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/faqs-report-an-issue), and we wish you the best of luck in your report.
