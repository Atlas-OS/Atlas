## Security Policy

### Vulnerability Reporting

At Atlas, our primary objective is to provide an optimal equilibrium between security, performance, and usability.

As Atlas is built on Windows, a proprietary operating system developed by Microsoft, we may not have solutions for security issues associated with Windows. Nonetheless, we are committed to addressing any security concerns caused by Atlas and welcome any enhancements made to the base Windows. We encourage the submission of GitHub issues and pull requests that relate to security vulnerabilities, as long as the solutions match our objective of having an equilibrium.

Should you discover any security flaws linked to the Atlas-specific software/tools or [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io/) (i.e., anything not related to Microsoft), kindly notify us immediately through the appropriate channels. For AME Wizard, please visit the [website](https://ameliorated.io/) to identify suitable contacts. For all other issues, report them to the corresponding Atlas repository as an issue.

Please note that some issues may not be rectifiable by us. If you come across a vulnerability in Atlas that is also present in the latest version of stock/vanilla Windows, please report it to Microsoft. For more information on reporting security vulnerabilities and pentesting, please visit the [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/faqs-report-an-issue) website. We wish you the best of luck in your reporting endeavor.
