## 🤔 **What is Atlas?**

Atlas is a modified version of Windows 10, which removes nearly all the drawbacks of Windows that adversely affects gaming performance.

We are also a good option to reduce system latency, network latency, input lag, and keep your system private while keeping our main focus on performance.

You can learn more about Atlas in our official [Website](https://atlasos.net).

## 👀 **Why Atlas?**

### 🔒 More private
Stock Windows contains tracking service that collects your data and upload them to Microsoft.
Atlas removes all types of tracking embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection. 

(Note. We cannot ensure the security for things outside the scope of Windows, Such as browsers, third-party apps.)

### 🛡️ More secure
Dowloading a modified ISO from the internet is risky. Not only it can contain malicious script, it also does not have the latest security patches that can put your computer under serious security risks. 
Atlas is different. We use [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io) to install, and all the scripts we use are Open-Sourced here in our repository. You can also apply the latest security updates before installing Atlas, keeping your system safe & secure.

### 🚀 More space
Atlas is heavily stripped, with pre-installed applications and other components are removed. Despite the possibility of compatibility issues, this significantly decreases ISO and install size. Functionalities such as Windows Defender, and such are stripped completely.

This modification is focused on pure gaming, but most work and education applications work. Check out what else we have removed in our [FAQ](https://docs.atlasos.net/Troubleshooting/Removed%20features/).

### ✅ More performance
Some tweaked systems on the internet has tweaked too far away, breaking compatibility for main features such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and etc.
Atlas is on the sweet point. While getting more performance, but also maintaing a good compatibility.

Some of the many changes that we have done to improve Windows have been listed below.

- Customized power scheme
- Reduced amount of services and drivers
- Disabled audio exclusive
- Disabled unneeded devices
- Disabled power savings
- Disabled performance-hungry security mitigations
- Automatically enabled MSI mode on all devices
- Boot configuration optimization
- Optimized process scheduling

### 🔒 Legal
Many custom Windows OSes distribute their systems by providing a tweaked ISO of Windows. Not only it violate [Microsoft's Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm), it is also not a safe way to install.

So, Atlas partnered with Windows Ameliorated Team to provide users a safer and legal way to install, the [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io). By using this, Atlas fully complies to [Microsoft's Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm).
