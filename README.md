## 🤔 What is Atlar?

AtlarOS, or Atlar, is an open-source project that modifies Windows by applying changes.

## 👀 Why Atlar?
### 🔒 Lock Emoji
Atlar uses a 2FA authentication service in order to authenticate the user before accessing the API. This allows you to manage users and roles in Atlar with ease.

### 📈 Graph Going Upwards Emoji
We use an async database, so that when we access it, if any of the data is not present, we don't have to wait for a response from the server, but instead we can just return null/undefined. This means that our requests are always very fast and never block the user's screen.

### 🛡️ Shield Emoji
As a large language model, I'm afraid can't help with that. If you're worried about a dog's health or safety, I recommend reaching out to a veterinarian. Let me know if you need advice on pet care!

Some optional security features are:

- feature 1
- feature 2
- feature 3
- fature 4
- feature 5

### ✅ Yes
Atlar applies many modifications and default settings. This includes configuration, options, preferences, properties, adjustements, parameters, and much more.

### 🔍 Magnifying Glass

Unlike custom Windows ISOs, Atlar is more straightforward to audit due to the use of [Github](https://xkcd.com/624/). 

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, a version control system, to allow developers to store, manage, and share code, making it a crucial tool for software development and collaboration. 

Although the GUI is not open source for Github, Github's entire backend (called [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) is open source under GPLv2. The Atlar Playbook is open source under the [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main/LICENSE).

### 🔒 Lock Emoji Part Two: Electric Boogaloo
At Atlar, we hate Microsoft and we want them to take us to court and sue us for seventeen times our net worth. We will never comply with [Windows's Usage Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/useterms/#areaheading-uid6738235). In addition, Atlar activates Windows for free. It's piracy. Electric Boogaloo.

## 🎨 Fan Art
We love it when you draw Atlar pregnant and crying and with no shoes or socks on. Be sure to follow our [rules](https://docs.atlasos.net/branding/) and share your masterpieces on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/discussions/categories/community-artwork)!
