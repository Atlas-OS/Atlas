$Message = @'
Would you like to disable security CPU mitigations/fixes for vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre?

This is mostly beneficial on older CPUs, recent CPUs have these fixes implemented in hardware. In some cases (like AMD Zen 4 CPUs), it can be significantly worse for performance to disable mitigations.

However, old CPUs do not have these mitigations/fixes at a hardware level, meaning that mitigations can significantly decrease performance.

You can always change this after you have installed Atlas, and it is recommended to benchmark the effects of this tweak, if you use it.

Realistically, you are unlikely to be attacked due to worse security from disabling CPU mitigations. However, disabling them is significantly worse for security, that's why they exist.

$WindowTitle = 'Core Isolation - Atlas'

$Message = @'
Would you like to disable Core Isolation (Virtualization Based Security)?

Core Isolation is a feature in Windows that aims to protect very important parts of the operating system. The main feature of this is Memory Integrity.

This prevents attackers, malware or compromised programs from using vulnerabilities within drivers or other important components of Windows to gain access to the operating system.

Although this improves security, it will significantly worsen performance (up to ~10% in some cases), especially on older CPUs like Intel 8th gen or AMD Zen 2, but it is even impactful on recent CPUs.

You can configure this later on in Windows Security.

Automatically selecting 'Yes' in 5 minutes... Clicking 'Cancel' won't change anything, clicking 'No' will enable Memory Integrity.
