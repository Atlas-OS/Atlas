# Clipboard History and Snip & Sketch
  Default: Disabled

# DEP
  Default: Disabled
  - In layman's terms, a mitigation (security fix) to prevent unauthorized programs from writing to protected memory. Game anti-cheats like Valorant/FACEIT use this.

  Configures windows firewall, frequently needed for Microsoft Store.

# FSO and Game Bar
  Default: Disabled
  - FSO (Fullscreen Optimizations) runs Fullscreen Exclusive games in a "highly optimized" borderless window, which allows for faster alt-tabbing.
    Disabling it is technically better for latency in theory, but FSO has developed quite significantly, and you probably won't notice a difference.

# Hyper-V and VBS

  - Fully enabled: 
      - Good for security, but you may see worse compatibility and worse performance
  - Windows Default:
      - Balanced for security, performance and compatibility. Should not impact performance too too much (especially on newer CPUs).

# Network Discovery

  - Prompt which asks for admin, if disabled, everything runs as an administrator (no option to run as a standard user)
	Breaks some things if disabled and slightly worsened security
	Set to not dim the desktop by default so that it's convienient, but not disabled

# UWP
  Default: Enabled
  - Disables many components related to UWP/AppX applications, will break many things like Store, Photos, Calculator, parts of Settings, etc...
    This is a pretty extreme form of 'debloating', only do this if you understand the risks.

# VPN

# Wi-Fi
  Default: Enabled

# Workstation (SMB)
  Default: Disabled
  - If you use SMB shares or AMD Ryzen Master, enable this.
